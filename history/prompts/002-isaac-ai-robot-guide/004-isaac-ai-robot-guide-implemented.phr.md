## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## Response snapshot

All tasks for generating the "The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) Guide" have been successfully completed. The technical guide content has been generated and written to `specs/002-isaac-ai-robot-guide/spec.md`, adhering to all specified formatting and content requirements. The `tasks.md` file has been updated to mark all tasks as complete.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Technical guide content generated successfully.
- 🧪 Tests: (none)
- 📝 Files: spec.md updated with content, tasks.md updated.
- ⏭️ Next prompts: No further prompts. The request is complete.
- 💡 Reflection: The implementation phase involved direct content generation and formatting based on the detailed spec and plan. The sequential execution of tasks, carefully adding sections to the `spec.md`, proved effective. The main challenge was ensuring all formatting requirements were met consistently.
