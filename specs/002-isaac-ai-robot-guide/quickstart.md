# Quickstart Guide: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) Technical Guide

**Date**: 2025-12-18
**Feature**: 002-isaac-ai-robot-guide

This quickstart guide provides instructions on how to access and view the generated technical guide for "Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)".

## Accessing the Technical Guide

The technical guide is generated as a Markdown file and placed within the feature's specification directory.

1.  **Navigate to the Feature Directory**:
    Open your terminal or file explorer and go to the following path within your project repository:
    ```bash
    ./specs/002-isaac-ai-robot-guide/
    ```

2.  **Locate the Guide File**:
    Inside this directory, you will find the main technical guide file:
    ```
    specs/002-isaac-ai-robot-guide/spec.md
    ```
    *(Note: This `spec.md` contains the detailed content of the technical guide, as per the specification for this feature.)*

3.  **View the Guide**:
    You can view the Markdown file using any Markdown viewer, editor, or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Markdown rendering. For optimal viewing, especially within the Docusaurus context, consider the following:

    *   **IDE with Markdown Preview**: Most modern IDEs (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA) have built-in Markdown previewers that render the content in a readable format.
    *   **GitHub/Web Browser**: If the project is hosted on GitHub, navigating to the `spec.md` file on the GitHub website will render it automatically.
    *   **Docusaurus Local Server**: If you have the Docusaurus project set up locally, you can serve the documentation to see how it appears within the book's framework. (Specific instructions for Docusaurus local server setup are outside the scope of this quickstart.)

## Content Structure

The technical guide `spec.md` is structured as follows:

*   **3-Day Lesson Breakdown**: Outlines topics for Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data, Isaac ROS & Visual SLAM, and Nav2 & Bipedal Movement.
*   **Code Implementation**: Includes a Python script example.
*   **Technical Deep Dive**: Compares LiDAR-based SLAM vs. Isaac’s VSLAM.
*   **Troubleshooting Guide**: Addresses common 'reality gap' issues.

This guide provides a comprehensive resource for understanding NVIDIA Isaac technologies in the context of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
