## Entities

### Technical Guide Content

This entity represents the primary output of this feature: a structured Markdown document. It is a conceptual entity defining the overall content, rather than a data structure with fields in a traditional database sense.

-   **Description**: A comprehensive Markdown document designed to serve as a technical guide for "Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)".
-   **Attributes**:
    -   **Format**: GitHub-Flavored Markdown.
    -   **Structure**: Organized into sections including a 3-day lesson breakdown, code implementation, technical deep dive, and troubleshooting guide.
    -   **Content Types**: Text, code blocks (Python), tables, headers (H2, H3), bold text.
    -   **Responsibility**: Encapsulates all information required by the feature specification.
-   **Relationships**: Consumed by `Student` entities. Generated by the system based on `Feature Specification`.

### Student

This entity represents the target audience and end-user of the generated technical guide. It is an external conceptual entity, not managed or stored by this feature.

-   **Description**: An advanced CS/Robotics student who has completed prerequisite courses (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity) and seeks to learn about NVIDIA Isaac technologies.
-   **Attributes**:
    -   **Background**: Familiarity with ROS 2 and simulation environments.
    -   **Objective**: To gain knowledge and practical skills in NVIDIA Isaac, photorealistic simulation, and GPU-accelerated perception.
-   **Relationships**: Consumes `Technical Guide Content`.

## Data Flows

-   **Input**: The feature specification (`specs/002-isaac-ai-robot-guide/spec.md`) serves as the primary input for generating the `Technical Guide Content`.
-   **Output**: The `Technical Guide Content` is produced as a Markdown file.
