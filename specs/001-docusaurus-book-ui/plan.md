# Implementation Plan: Docusaurus Book UI and Navigation Implementation

**Branch**: `001-docusaurus-book-ui` | **Date**: 2025-12-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-docusaurus-book-ui/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of the user interface and navigation for the Docusaurus-based textbook. The core requirement is to create a custom two-column landing page, implement navigation controls, and ensure the structure supports future localization features, all within the Docusaurus framework.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES6+), React
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus v2
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Manual validation based on acceptance criteria in `spec.md`.
**Target Platform**: Web (GitHub Pages)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend)
**Performance Goals**: Landing page achieves a Google PageSpeed Insights score of 90+ for accessibility and performance on desktop.
**Constraints**: UI must adhere to a modern, academic, and clean aesthetic. All implementation must use Docusaurus components and structure.
**Scale/Scope**: A single book with approximately 15 chapters.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Book Framework**: The plan uses Docusaurus, which aligns with the constitution.
- **Hosting**: The plan targets GitHub Pages for deployment, which aligns with the constitution.
- **Authoring Tools**: The plan is being created with Spec-Kit Plus, which aligns with the constitution.

**Result**: PASS. The plan adheres to all relevant constitutional principles.

        └── TOC/
            └── index.js
```

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow a standard Docusaurus frontend structure. New components will be created in `src/components`, and Docusaurus theme components will be "swizzled" into `src/theme` for customization.

## Phased Implementation

### Phase 1: Research (20% Time)

* **Goal:** Identify the most efficient way to implement the custom two-column layout and dynamic button placement in Docusaurus.
* **Research Approach:** Investigate Docusaurus custom pages vs. custom component wrapping (`swizzling`) for layout injection. Determine the best practice for placing non-content elements (like the Translation Button) within the chapter component without modifying core Docusaurus output.
* **Output:** A `research.md` file documenting the selection of the Docusaurus "swizzle" theme component method.

### Phase 2: Foundation (30% Time)

* **Goal:** Set up the basic structural components and layout logic.
* **Architecture Sketch:**
    * **Landing Page:** Use a custom Docusaurus Home Page component. Implement a main `<div>` with CSS Grid or Flexbox to define the **Left Column** (50% width) and **Right Column** (50% width).
    * **Left Column:** Render `<BookTitle/>`, `<FeatureButtons/>`, and navigation links.
    * **Right Column:** Render the `<ThematicImage/>` component.
* **Decisions Needing Documentation:**
    1. **Layout Method:** CSS Grid vs. Flexbox for two-column split. (Tradeoff: Flexibility vs. Simplicity).
    2. **Chapter Navigation:** Standard Docusaurus sidebar vs. embedded `Table of Contents` component in the Left Column. (Tradeoff: Default behavior vs. Custom Look).
* **Output:** A `quickstart.md` file with instructions on how to run the Docusaurus development server.

### Phase 3: Implementation (40% Time)

* **Goal:** Write the necessary React/Docusaurus code and implement the Success Criteria.
* **Section Structure:**
    * `/src/components/ThematicImage.js`: Component for the right column image.
    * `/src/theme/CustomLayout.js`: Component wrapping the default Docusaurus layout to implement the two-column structure for the landing page.
    * `/src/components/StartCourseButton.js`: Component for navigation button.
    * `/src/theme/TOC/index.js`: Modification or wrapper to move navigation.
    * **Button Placeholders:** Implement empty React components for `Login/Auth` and `TranslationToggle` within the Left Column and at the top of a sample chapter content page.
* **Output:** A `tasks.md` file will be generated by the `/sp.tasks` command to break down the implementation into smaller tasks.

### Phase 4: Validation (10% Time)

* **Goal:** Verify all platform requirements and UI/UX constraints are met.
* **Quality Validation (Acceptance Criteria Checklist):**
    * [ ] **Two-Column Layout:** Landing page renders correctly with dedicated left/right columns.
    * [ ] **Navigation Check:** "Start Course" button successfully links to the **first chapter of Module 1**.
    * [ ] **Aesthetic Check:** Styling meets "modern, academic, and clean aesthetic" requirement.
    * [ ] **Localization Support:** The dedicated placeholder component for the "Translation Toggle" is correctly positioned at the start of a sample chapter's content area.
    * [ ] **Responsive Check:** The layout stacks correctly on mobile and tablet devices.
